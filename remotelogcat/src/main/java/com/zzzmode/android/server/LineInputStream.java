/**
 * LineInputStream decorates an InputStream for line-by-line reading.
 * It implements a <code>readLine()</code> method, similar to
 * <code>BufferedReader</code>, but does not need an intermediate
 * <code>InputStreamReader</code> to translate.
 *
 * <p>The reason we avoid an <code>InputStreamReader</code> is that it
 * will consume as much of the input as it possibly can in order
 * to optimize character encoding from the input bytes.
 *
 * <p>In our case, the input will be switching protocols from an HTTP
 * Request to WebSocket frames. We want to consume the HTTP Request
 * line by line and process it for a WebSocket handshake, but the
 * data following that must be handled in a completely different way.
 *
 * <p>The ability to handle the data line-by-line like
 * <code>BufferedReader</code> is able to do, is very useful for
 * parsing the HTTP Reqeust. Therefore we have ListInputStream to
 * provide this functionality as an InputStream decorator.
 *
 * <p>Unlike <code>BufferedReader</code>, which handles three kinds of
 * line endings (CR, LF, CRLF), the HTTP protocol has defined the line
 * ending to be CRLF. Therefore, the <code>readLine()</code> method of
 * this decorator requires a CRLF (or EOF) sequence to terminate a line.
